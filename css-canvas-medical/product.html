          Canvas creates a shared understanding for patient care across clincians, staff,
          and patients themselves - making you more productive, less stressed, and adding
          just a bit more joy into your practice of medicine.

            You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or bounce around
            five windows to discover the last blood count. Canvas pulls everthing you
            need directly into your note, so you never have to leave it. And because
            Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every patient
            you see.

          <p><em>&ldquo;Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance dramatically on key
          quality metrics, and is incredibly easy to use. The right information is
          presented in the right way at the right time, and the product leverages
          technology to actually improve the quality of care I provide.&rdquo;</em></p>
