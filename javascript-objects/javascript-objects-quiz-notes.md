## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are objects used for?
Objects are used to store a collection of variables, objects and/or functions to create more complex entities.
- What are object properties?
Object properties are variables stored inside an object.
- Describe object literal notation.
Object literal notation is a way to create/declare an object. It consists of a variable name followed by an assignment operator and key-value pairs nested inside curly braces and separated by commas.
- How do you remove a property from an object?
To delete a property, use the delete keyword followed by the object name and property name in dot or bracket notation.
- What are the two ways to get or update the value of a property?
The two ways are called dot and bracket notation. Dot notation is the object name followed by the property name separated by a period. Bracket notation is the object name followed by the property name as a string inside a pair of brackets. Either one you choose, just use the assignment operator to reassign/update the value.
