# data-structures-linked-lists-notes

## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How are linked lists different from an array?
  Linked lists differ from arrays in that they are sequential access, not random access.
  They have to be accessed in order. There is no other option.
- How would you access an arbitrary node in a linked list (not just the "head")?
  Create a variable that holds the value of the index we want to be at.
  Use a while loop that goes to the next node until you are at the desired index.
  The while loop needs to decrement that index.
