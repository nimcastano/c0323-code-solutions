## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of variables?
A variable is used to store data.
- How do you **declare** a variable?
In order to declare a variable, you need to use a variable keyword followed by a variable name.
- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
To intialize a variable, you use the assignment operator, "=". Placing it between the variable declaration and a data value assigns that variable with that value.
- What characters are allowed in variable names?
It must begin with a letter, $ or an underscore. The name can consist of letters, numbers, $ and underscores.
- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
If the casing of the letters in the variable name are even slightly different, they will refer to different things. For example, variables score and Score are two different variable names.
- What is the purpose of a string?
Strings are used to work with any kind of text. This can be to display text onto the page or manipulate user-entered data.
- What is the purpose of a number?
The main purpose is for tasks that have to do with counting and performing mathematical equations.
- What is the purpose of a boolean?
They are used to decide which part of a script should run. They only have two possible values, true or false.
- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
It is the assignment operator and is used to assign values to variables.
- How do you update the value of a variable?
The syntax remains the same as declaring a variable except without the variable keyword, let, var or const. Instead, just use the variable name followed by the assignment operator and the new/updated value of the variable.
- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
Although they are both considered to be primitive data types, undefined is the unintentional absence of a value while null is the intentional absence of a value.
- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
A label lets us know what exactly is being logged onto the console rather than it just logging to the console and we have to reread our code just to make sure of what it is logging.
- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
String, boolean, number, null and undefined.
