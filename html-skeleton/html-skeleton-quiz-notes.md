## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Where do you put non-visible content about the HTML document?
You can use the ccomment tags, <!-- and -->, to put content in the html document that will not be visible on to the viewer of the webpage.
- Where do you put visible content about the HTML document?
The visible content is pretty much everything that is not commented away. If it is within an opening and closing tag, it will likely show up somewhere on the html document, especially if it is within the body tags.
- Where do the `<head>` and `<body>` tags go in a valid HTML document?
The head and body tags go in between the html tags. They are separate entities and not opened within each other.
- What is the purpose of a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration?
The DOCTYPE declaration tells a browser what version of HTML the page is using. Different versions have different doctype declarations.
