## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Why do we log things to the console?
We log things to the concolse to keep track that we are getting the right values we wanted.
- What is a method?
A method is a key-value pair in an object with a value of a function.
- How is a method different from any other function?
A method is specifically only referred to as a method if it is inside an object.
- How do you remove the last element from an array?
You use the pop() method to remove the last element from the array.
- How do you round a number down to the nearest integer?
You use the Math.floor() method.
- How do you generate a random number?
You use the Math.random() method but this only returns a number between 0 and 1 so you need to make mathematical expressions with the method to get it to work with the desired range.
- How do you delete an element from an array?
There are multiple ways to do so depending on where the element is in the array. You can use the shift method if it is in the beginning of the array. The pop method works if the element is at the end of the array. If it is in the middle, you can use the splice method.
- How do you append an element to an array?
If you want a new element at the end of the array, you can use the push method. If you want it at a specific index, you can use the splice method. If you want it at the front, you can use the unshift method.
- How do you break a string up into an array?
You can use the split method and split the string up into characters or words.
- Do string methods change the original string? How would you check if you weren't sure?
They do not. To make sure, we can log the value of the result of using a method to the console to ensure that it is the desired value.
- Roughly how many string methods are there according to the MDN Web docs?
There are ROUGHLY 60 different string methods according to MDN.
- Is the return value of a function or method useful in every situation?
No. Sometimes we just want it to log something to the console.
- Roughly how many array methods are there according to the MDN Web docs?
There are VERY roughly about 60 different methods for arrays according to MDN.
- What three-letter acronym should you always include in your Google search about a JavaScript method or CSS property?
Always include MDN.
