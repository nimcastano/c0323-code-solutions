## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
A loop is used to iterate through a data set and perform certain actions for every element in said set.
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
A condition is commonly used to check whether the loop needs to run. Generally, if the expression returns true, the loop will run.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
Iteration refers to every time the loop runs.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
The condition expression of a while loop runs before the iteration.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
The initialization expression runs once at the beginning of the loop before the first iteration.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
The condition expression runs before every iteration.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
The final expression runs after every iteration.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
The break keyword can be used to exit a loop.
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
The increment operator is commonly used as a counter in loops to make sure it does not run infinitely.
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
You use a for...in loop to iterate through the keys of an object.
