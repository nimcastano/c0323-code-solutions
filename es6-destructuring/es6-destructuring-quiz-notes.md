## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  Destructuring is the process of breaking something down piece by piece.
- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  The syntax is a declaration statement followed by curly braces. If you want to define multiple variables, each variable is separated by a comma.
  After the closing curly brace, there is an assignment operator and the name of the object we are retrieving the values from.
- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  The syntax is very similar to object destructuring but instead of the curly braces, they are square brackets. The variable names are also separated by commas.
  There is also an assignment operator after the clsoing square bracket and the name of the array we are retrieving the values from.
- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  Object and array destructuring and creation are different because of the placement of the curly/square brackets in relation to the assignment operator.
  In destructuring, they are on the left side. In creation, they are on the right side.
