## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
A breakpoint is the point at which a media query takes effect.
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) `width` instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) `width` for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
Zooming in and out takes no effect of the responsiveness of the page.
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
Because of the rules for specificity, the later one will take precedence.
