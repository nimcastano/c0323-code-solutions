## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

  Webpack is a bundler that packages and bundles all the code for JS files.
  It is use because it shrinks the code by renaming variables and functions, throwing away unsued code,
  among other use cases.

  versions of JS.
