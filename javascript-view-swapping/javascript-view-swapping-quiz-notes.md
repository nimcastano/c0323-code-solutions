## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the `event.target`?
The event target is the object/element that the event is triggered by.
- What is the affect of setting an element to `display: none`?
It hides the content from the user and makes the content seem like it was never there.
- What does the `element.matches()` method take as an argument and what does it return?
The parameter is a CSS selector and the return is a boolean depending on if the element matches the parameter.
- How can you retrieve the value of an element's attribute?
The getAttribute() method.
- At what steps of the solution would it be helpful to log things to the console?

- If you were to add another tab and view to your HTML, but you didn't use event delegation, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?

- If you didn't use a loop to conditionally show or hide the views in the page, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?
