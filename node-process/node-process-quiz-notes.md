## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a computer process?
  A computer process is the instance of a computer program being executed.
- Roughly how many computer processes are running on your host operating system (Task Manager or Activity Monitor)?
  Only one is running and 26-29 are sleeping.
- Why should a full stack Web developer know that computer processes exist?
  Because it tells us how many programs are running asynchronously, all using a bit of the memory. To ensure optimization,
  we need to keep track of how many programs are running and keep it at a minimum.
  Also to make sure that the processes we want are running are IN FACT running.
