## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are JavaScript classes?
JavaScript classes are used as templates for creating objects.
- When would you want to use a class?
When you want to make multiple objects with similar properties. It makes it a lot easier to create a number of objects quickly. Takes advantage of inheritance (polymorphism).
We can also add/modify existing properties/methods from a parent class when making an child class.
- How do you declare a class?
Using the class keyword followed by the name of the class.
- How do you inherit from another class?
By making it a child of another class using the extends clause.
- Why would you want to inherit from another class?
It helps us keep our script concise and from becoming bloated. It is better than making a new class every time, especially when there are methods or properties that already exist in another class.
- How do you add methods and properties to a class?
You use a constructor inside the class to add properties and you just use method defintion to outside of the constructor to add methods.
