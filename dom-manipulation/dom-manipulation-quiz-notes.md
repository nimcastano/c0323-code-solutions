## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the `className` property of element objects?
The className property returns the name of the class assigned to the element.
- How do you update the CSS class attribute of an element using JavaScript?
You just reassign it using the assignment operator and the className property of the element.
- What is the `textContent` property of element objects?
The text content property returns the text wrapped in the element selected.
- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?
You just reassign it using the assignment operator and the textContent property of the element.
- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?
Yes, otherwise it will take any user input as the the event and it will trigger it.
- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?
More complicated. It makes the code more readable and easier to understand. Also makes it so we don't have to keep having to access it through the DOM.
- Why is storing information about a program in variables better than only storing it in the DOM?
It makes it easier for us to refer to it for future use.
