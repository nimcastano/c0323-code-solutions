## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the **default** value for the `position` property of HTML elements?
The default value is static. This is also known as normal flow.
- How does setting `position: relative` on an element affect document flow?
The order of when things appear stays the same so document flow remains the same.
- How does setting `position: relative` on an element affect where it appears on the page?
The relative value allows us to move the block of the element wherever we want in relation to where it would be in normal flow.
- How does setting `position: absolute` on an element affect document flow?
It can completely change document flow because the elements with absolute positioning act like the other elements do not exist on the page.
- How does setting `position: absolute` on an element affect where it appears on the page?
The absolute value allows us to move the block of the element wherever we want on the page and that becomes its new position, even if it overlaps over other elements.
- How do you constrain an absolutely positioned element to a containing block?
You put it under a parent element and have that parent element have a non-static positioning.
- What are the four box offset properties?
Top, bottom, left and right.
