## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
Functions are used to package up code for use later in the script. They are reusable and therefore very useful when needing to perform the same process multiple times.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
The function keyword is simply declaring that what's followed is a function.
A name is optional but gives a function the ability to be called on at a later time.
Parameters are placeholders in parentheses for the data values that will later be used within the function.
The code block is the entire part of the code within the curly braces that make up the function.
A return statement is optional but it allows us to return data and stops the function from running any more when the function is called upon.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
A function call consists of the function name and the arguments being passed to the function within the parentheses.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
A call is made up of much less code because the code is already written out in the function defintion. Another difference is that definitions have curly braces.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
A parameter is a stand-in in the function definition until the function is called and those parameters are replaced by the arguments passed-in. In short, arguments have real values and parameters do not.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
Because they are unknown, they are replaceable.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
It stops the function from running anymore and provides data when the function is called.
