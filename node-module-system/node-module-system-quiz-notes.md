After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a JavaScript module?
  A JavaScript module is simply JS programs that are separated. In essence, they are just different files.
- What are the advantages of modular programming?
  The advantages include a more structured code with less clutter and a better control flow since it only
  uses programs we need at that time. It also makes it more readable and much less often is one repeating
  themselves in the code.
- In JavaScript, how do you make a function in a module available to other modules?
  You have to have an export statement in the same file as said function with the argument being the function
  you want to make available to other modules.

  You have to import it from that other module/file.
