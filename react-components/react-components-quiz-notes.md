## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a React component?
  A react component is a function that is written in JSX and returns HTML elements.
- How do you define a component in React?
  You define a function just like how you would in vanilla JS. The return statement should be wrapped in
  parentheses. It should also be wrapped all in one closure. For example, one <div> tag. The component
  name also has to be in PascalCase.
- How is a component "rendered" (made visible on the browser page)?
  You use the ReactDOM.render() with two arguments, the component name and the element on the DOM
  you want it to be appended to.
